 * answers the two numbers a trader wants right after pasting a key, their equity and how
 * many positions Kaaval can see.

 * retryable saying whether trying again in a minute could help. Nothing here throws,
 * because the caller is a sign-in form and a stack trace is not an answer.
 *
 * surface is the read-only context to go through. It exists so a caller that already
 * built one does not build a second, and so the tests can put a stand-in Bitget behind
 * this function; left out, the credentials get their own context from contextFor, which
