 * One GET, over Node's fetch, with node:http as the fallback.
 *
 * GDELT's api host resolves to a single IPv4 address whose TCP handshake took 11 to 15
 * seconds from this machine when measured on 2026-09-08. Node's fetch abandons a connect
 * after 10 seconds and that limit cannot be raised without pulling in undici, so roughly
 * three calls in four failed with UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT while curl and node:https both
 * succeeded. The fallback takes our own timeout, so the slow handshake completes. A real
 * HTTP answer, including a 404 or a 429, comes straight back from fetch and never
 * reaches the fallback.
 *
 * Both legs are bounded by timeoutMs, covering the headers and the body read, so the
 * longest a dead host can hold a tick is two budgets: one for fetch failing to connect
 * and one for the fallback. Our own timeout skips the fallback, because a host that has
 * already used the whole budget has answered the question.
