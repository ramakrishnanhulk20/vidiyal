 * symbol instead of a ticker and a candle page. It is keyed by context and holds one entry
 * per symbol, so two contexts never share an answer and the map cannot grow past the

 * How far the round-the-clock price has walked away from the last regular US close.
 *
 * The anchor is the close of the 15 minute candle that ends at 16:00 ET on the last
 * trading day, taken from Bitget's own market for this exact symbol. That matters:
 * it needs no NYSE price feed and no third-party quote, so the number is computable
 * from Bitget data alone and compares like with like. anchorTs is the start of that
 * candle, which closes fifteen minutes later at the bell. When the exact candle is
 * missing, because the symbol did not trade in that quarter hour, the newest candle
 * before the bell is used instead and anchorTs shows which one.
 *
 * A caller that has already read this symbol's ticker in this tick passes it as `known`,
 * so the drift is measured against the same price the rest of the tick is using and the
 * symbol costs one request rather than two.
